# Formula 1 Grand Prix Predictor

## Overview
The **Formula 1 Grand Prix Predictor** project utilizes machine learning to predict the outcomes of Formula 1 (F1) races. By training a **Random Forest** model with data scraping techniques and leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Scikit Learn** for model building, this project aims to predict race results based on historical data.

## Features
- **Random Forest Model**: A supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict race outcomes.
- **Data Scraping**: Collects historical Formula 1 data using web scraping techniques for feature engineering.
- **Data Processing**: Uses Pandas to clean, manipulate, and prepare data for analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualizations**: Displays key insights and predictions via data visualizations.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit Learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **BeautifulSoup / Requests**: For scraping race results and related historical data from the web.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps to run the project:
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Formula-1-Grand-Prix-Predictor.git
cd Formula-1-Grand-Prix-Predictor
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. To scrape historical race data, run the scraper script:

```bash
python data_scraper.py
```

4. After gathering the data, preprocess and clean it with:

```bash
python data_preprocessor.py
```

5. Train the model using the following script:

```bash
python model_trainer.py
```

6. Finally, make predictions using the trained model:

```bash
python make_predictions.py
```

## Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pandas as pd

# Load preprocessed data
data = pd.read_csv('race_data.csv')

# Define features and target
X = data[['qualifying_position', 'driver_skill', 'team_performance', 'weather_conditions']]
y = data['race_outcome']

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict race outcome
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
```

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using standard classification metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted outcomes.
- **Precision and Recall**: For evaluating the quality of the predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visually assess classification results.

## Data Sources
- [Formula 1 Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/)
- Additional historical race data may be scraped from various F1-related APIs or websites.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find bugs, want to improve the model, or add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
